    <h1>COVID-19 advice for the public: Getting vaccinated</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Why get vaccinated against COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>The emergency phase of COVID-19 is over, but the virus continues to spread and endanger people's lives, particularly those who are older, have chronic diseases, are immunocompromised or pregnant.</p>
    
    <p>Safe and effective vaccines help ensure that COVID-19 does not result in severe disease and death. In 2021 alone, COVID-19 vaccines saved an estimated 14.4 million lives worldwide. Vaccination also reduces the likelihood of new variants from emerging.  </p>
    <p>Check your COVID-19 vaccination status and consult with your healthcare provider for any needed doses.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2>COVID-19 vaccines are safe.</h2>
    <p>Strict precautions are in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
    <p>Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines were subject to rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy.</p>
    <p>Unprecedented scientific collaborations, extensive prior research and substantial public funding enabled swift COVID-19 vaccine development to be completed in record time – while maintaining high safety standards. New versions of the vaccine are being developed as the COVID-19 virus continues to circulate and change.</p>
    <p>Since 2021, more than 13 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally. As with all vaccines, WHO and regulatory authorities continuously monitor the use of COVID-19 vaccines to identify and respond to any safety issues that might arise. Serious reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare. Through this process, we establish that COVID-19 vaccines remain safe worldwide.</p>
    <h2>Who should get vaccinated and boosted?</h2>
    <p>In November 2023, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization (SAGE) updated the recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination in the context of extensive population immunity resulting from vaccination and/or infection.</p>
    <p>The table below outlines the updated recommendations based on a person’s (1) vaccination history and (2) age and health condition. </p>

    <h2>Getting vaccinated: Specific advice</h2>
    <li>
        <b>Take whatever vaccine is made available to you</b>, even if you have already had COVID-19. Hybrid immunity (the protection one receives from vaccination and COVID-19 infection) enhances protection against the severe outcomes of future COVID-19 infections and confers longer protection.
        It is also safe and effective to mix and match different COVID-19 vaccines. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>If you are pregnant, want to get pregnant in the future or are currently breastfeeding, getting vaccinated is important to protect you and your family.</b> Many people around the world have now been vaccinated against COVID-19 while pregnant or breastfeeding, and no safety concerns have been identified for them or their babies.
        
    </li>
    <li><b>You should not be vaccinated if: </b><br>
        You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine.You have a fever over 38.5ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment. Postpone until you have recovered.

    </li>
    <li><b>If you are on blood thinners, it is safe for you to get vaccinated, but let the person vaccinating know. </b></li>
    <h2>What to expect after getting vaccinated</h2>
    <li><b>Some people will experience mild side effects after being vaccinated against COVID-19.</b> Common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines include fever, head or body aches and a sore arm. These symptoms usually go away within a day or two and, if needed, can be managed by getting some rest, drinking fluids, or taking pain-relieving medications.
        <br><b>Contact your healthcare provider if you are worried about any of the side effects that you are experiencing. </b><br>
        If you do get COVID-19 after vaccination, you are more likely to have <b>mild or no symptoms</b> than if you had not been vaccinated.
    </li>
    <li><b>Vaccination should not be delayed in anticipation of newer versions of the COVID-19 vaccine.</b> Currently approved COVID-19 vaccines, including those based on the index virus and the bivalent vaccines, continue to protect against severe disease. <br>
        For people at a high risk of getting severe COVID-19, a dose of any available vaccine is more beneficial than delaying vaccination. <br>
        Many COVID-19 manufacturers have developed or are in the process of developing monovalent XBB vaccines. When such vaccines become available, those eligible for revaccination could consider such vaccines.
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>It takes several weeks after each dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for your body to develop maximum levels of immunity – you are not protected right away. </b>We still don’t know exactly how long protection from COVID-19 vaccines lasts, but most people have strong protection against serious illness and death for at least 6 months. 
        

    </li>
    <li>
        <b>It is still possible to get COVID-19 and spread it to others after being vaccinated, so continue to do everything you can to keep yourself and others healthy. </b>Continue following the advice of your health authorities. Wash your hands regularly and cover coughs and sneezes. 
    </li>
